# Odin Rock Paper Scissors
JS rock paper scissors project for TOP (The Odin Project).

This is the first JS project - It was played from console at first, but
after some days I got to the part of revisiting this project, and reworking
it with UI &Â adding responsiveness. Of course, some logic also had to be changed.
- I've also added a special konami-like code easter egg, that people could perhaps
find if they understood the reference by site UI. ðŸ˜› Or you could just look at
JS code in files lol.
